# 📚 Book Recommender System Using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Overview
This is a **Book Recommender System** built using **Machine Learning** and **Streamlit**. It suggests books similar to user-selected titles using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The system leverages a dataset of book ratings to identify books with similar reader preferences.

## 🔥 Features
✅ **Select a Book** from a dropdown list  
✅ **Get Recommendations** for similar books  
✅ **View Book Posters** with image URLs  
✅ **Fast & Efficient** ML-powered recommendations  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning**: KNN Algorithm  
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Streamlit  
- **Data Format**: Sparse Matrices for efficient storage  
- **UI Framework**: Streamlit
